A bit of introduction about library management system : 
     A library management system (LMS) is a software solution designed to facilitate the management
of library resources and services. It serves as a centralized platform for librarians to organize, 
catalog, circulate, and track various materials such as books, journals, multimedia, and other resources within a
library's collection. The primary objective of an LMS is to streamline library operations,
enhance user experience, and improve access to information for patrons.
